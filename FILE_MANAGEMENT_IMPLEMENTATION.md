## Technical Implementation

### Models
```python
class PDFFile(models.Model):
    original_filename = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    google_drive_file_id = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    google_drive_filename = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    google_drive_web_view_link = models.URLField()
    google_drive_web_content_link = models.URLField()
    google_drive_file_size = models.BigIntegerField()
    extracted_text = models.TextField()
    page_count = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    status = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    upload_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    created_by = models.ForeignKey(User)
    error_message = models.TextField()
```

### API Endpoints
